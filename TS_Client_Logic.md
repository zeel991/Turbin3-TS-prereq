## Assignment - 2

### Why do you think Solana has chosen during most of its history to use TypeScript for Client-side development?

I feel there are two major reasons why it chose TypeScript:

1. **Type Safety**  
   TypeScript's type safety helps developers prevent mistakes while parsing data to complex transactions, and provides strict data types for each input.

2. **Browser Compatibility**  
   TypeScript compiles down to JavaScript, which ensures it works seamlessly across all browsers.
